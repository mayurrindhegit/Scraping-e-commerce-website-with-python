91,Karuizawa 1984Bot.2013 Sherry Cask #3663,"£6,500",5(1 Review),"A great single cask bottling from closed Karuizawa - distilled in 1984, matured in sherry cask #3663 and bottled in 2013. Big, rich and packed with sherry fruit.Tasting Notes (1) "
92,Karuizawa 198133 Year Old Cask #136,"£7,000",,"A vintage Karuizawa from 1981 that was released by La Maison du Whisky as part of its Artifices Series, that bears labels from various artists – this version was created by Singapore artist Warren Khong. The whisky itself, like many Karuizawas, was aged in an ex-sherry cask and delivers full-bodied spicy flavours."
93,Karuizawa 197935 Year Old Cask #8187,"£7,000",,"With only 350 bottles produced and the distillery now several years closed, the Karuizawa 1979 35-year-old might safely be called one of the rarest Japanese whiskies in existence. In the glass, it opens with an unapologetically alcoholic nose – no surprise given its substantial 58.8% ABV – but wait this out and be rewarded with wafts of gentle coffee and orchard fruit, fresh pine and rich soil. More delightful conflict awaits in the mouth, where wispy, spiced citrus wars with rich tobacco, old wood and a creeping hint of aniseed. A stunning example of Japanese elegance in whisky form."
94,Karuizawa 1983Bot.2014 Sherry Cask,"£7,000",5(2 Reviews),This 1983 Karuizawa has spent its life in first-fill sherry casks and was bottled in 2014 for a private customer.
95,Karuizawa 1980Bot.2015,"£7,500",,"Previewed at The Whisky Exchange Whisky Show 2015 as a Dream Dram, Karuizawa 1980 The Golden Samurai is one of the finest examples of sherry-cask-matured Japanese whisky we have ever tried. Bottled from a single cask, there are only a very limited number of bottles available."
96,HanyuThe Joker Colour Label,"£7,500",4.5(2 Reviews),"The eagerly-anticipated final release from the Ichiro's Malt Card series bottlings from the closed Hanyu distillery. This is a vatting of six vintages (1985, 1986, 1988, 1990, 1991 and 2000) from a total of seven types of cask (chibidaru, bourbon, Madeira, hogshead, Cognac, puncheon and sherry butt).Tasting Notes (1) "
97,Karuizawa 198429 Years Old Sherry Cask #3662,"£8,500",,"This sherry-matured Karuizawa was a joint bottling between The Whisky Exchange and Japanese company Shinanoya. Distilled in 1984 and aged for 29 years, 271 bottles were produced at 61%."
98,Karuizawa 30 Year OldBourbon Cask #8606,"£8,500",,"A contrast to its companion 31yo sherried release, this Karuizawa 30 year old has been matured solely in bourbon casks. A break from the distillery's usual character and one of only a handful of similar releases – intense and showing another side of this closed, cult distillery."
99,Karuizawa 1984First Fill Sherry Cask #4021,"£8,500",,"Another enormously potent first fill sherry cask from Karuizawa, this was distilled in 1984 and displays very big earthy savoury notes, overcooked Dundee cake, leathery fruit and a hint of smoke. At 64.5% a drop of water (or four) is perfectly acceptable, but we actually preferred this one neat.Tasting Notes (1) "
100,Karuizawa 1981Bot.2014 Sherry Cask,"£10,000",,"Whiskies from Karuizawa are some of the most sought after in the world. Not only has the distillery closed, but its heavily sherried drams have a reputation for excellence that has only grown over the past few years. This 1981 sherry-cask-matured dram was previewed at The Whisky Show 2014, where it went down a storm."
101,Karuizawa 31 Year OldSapphire Geisha,"£15,000",,"A 31-year-old Karuizawa single malt, matured in a single sherry cask for more than three decades before being bottled by Elixir Distillers exclusively for The Whisky Exchange's Karuizawa Geishas series.

102,Karuizawa 29 Year OldBourbon Cask #8897,"£17,500",,"One of a pair of mirror-image labelled bottles released at The Whisky Exchange Whisky Show 2014. This is the bourbon-matured half of the duo, although its deep and rich colour is more reminiscent of a heavily sherried dram. This sold out during the weekend of The Whisky Show."
103,Karuizawa 36 Year OldSapphire Geisha,"£18,000",,"A 36-year-old Karuizawa single malt, matured in a single sherry cask for more than three decades before being bottled by Elixir Distillers exclusively for The Whisky Exchange's Karuizawa Geishas series.

104,Karuizawa 35 Year OldBourbon Cask 8518 Emerald Geisha,"£18,000",5(2 Reviews),"Karuizawa's whiskies are legendary. Not only are they of sublime quality, but the distillery's closure almost 20 years ago means that they are rarer than emeralds. This exclusive single-cask bottling of 35-year-old single malt, created by Elixir Distillers, layers vanilla and spiced butter around the Karuizawa core.The distinctive emerald labels combine beautiful Japanese art forms with complex hot foil and intricate embossing embellishments, giving the bottles a sculptured finish.

As with the rest of the series, the Pearl Geisha labels were designed by The Whisky Exchange’s creative director Raj Chavda, who is also a fellow of the Royal Society of Art."
107,Karuizawa 30 Year OldSherry Cask #5347,"£20,000",,"The sherried half of a pair of Karuizawas launched at The Whisky Show 2014. Hugely popular, the tasting bottles were emptied in the first few minutes of each day of the show and the whisky sold out not long after. An intense, savoury and spicy whisky."

The oldest and most famous Karuizawa ever bottled when it appeared at the tail-end of 2009, we only ever had around 200 bottles of this one, and after Whiskyfun and Whiskynotes both gave it humungous 95 point scores, it sold out in a little over 24 hours.Tasting Notes (2) "
109,Hanyu 1990Queen of Hearts Cask #9102,"£25,000",,"One of a series of really terrific Japanese malts from the sadly now defunct Hanyu distillery. Bursting with character and complexity, these masterpieces from a 'lost' distillery are pricey, but well worth it. A massive hit at this year's Whisky Live.Tasting Notes (3) "
